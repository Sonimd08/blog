    <p>The ancient art of henna body painting — widely used in India, Africa, and the Middle East — varies from country to country and spans different cultures and religious traditions. Aside from the modern use of henna as a trendy, temporary tattoo, traditional designs have been used to celebrate weddings, births, and religious holidays.
        This collection of charming images, adapted from authentic mehndi designs, incorporates more than 160 lovely, royalty-free patterns (largely Indian) that are used to cover hands, forearms, and feet. Included are fine line, lacy, and paisley motifs; detailed images of exotic birds and human faces, assorted floral borders, heart-shaped insets, and repeat patterns featuring abstracts and woven tendrils.
        Of use to artists, designers, and craftworkers, these decorative motifs will also provide an exciting glimpse into the rich store of Indian ornamental art.

    <p>Mehndi is a popular form of body art in South Asia and resembles similar traditions of henna as body art found in North Africa, East Africa and the Middle East. There are many different names for mehndi across the languages of South Asia.
        There are many variations and designs. Women usually apply mehndi designs to their hands and feet, though some, including cancer patients and women with alopecia, occasionally decorate their scalps.[2] The standard color of henna is brown, but other design colors such as white, red, black and gold are sometimes used.
